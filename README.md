## Thoughts and something need to improve
With limited time (I'm doing full-time coop in a busy startup) and only one person, I was only able to finish the step counting module in my original capstone design. Professor Feinberg is right, my original design was too much for one person.

The step counting algorithm was based on our course material and an open source algorithm about using accelerator to count steps in Android. I found my implementation was OK with some phones but was not always accurate with the rest. I tried to modify the algorithm and it seems working a little better with my Motorola E4. There might be better algorithms out there for better counting the steps and I would have improved it if given more time.

## Thank you!
It's my first time taking an online course. Although it's been busy, sometimes struggling, with the help of the professor and our TA I was able to finish it. Thank you again for all the help!
